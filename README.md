## Installation

Clone & create this repo locally with the following command:

```bash
npx Turbocamp@latest init my-saas-project
```

Or, deploy with Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdroidsize%2FTurbocamp)

### Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes! We'll set up your **Marketing Site**, **Dashboard**, and **API** - the three core components that power your application.

> **🚀 Architecture Note**: Our centralized API structure makes this template incredibly flexible - you can easily add mobile apps (React Native/Expo), desktop apps (Electron), or any other client that needs to connect to your backend.

> **🔒 Type-Safe Environment**: Turbocamp uses [@t3-oss/env-nextjs](https://env.t3.gg/) for type-safe environment variables. All env vars are validated at build time with full TypeScript support!

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 2. Database Setup (Prisma + Neon)

We use **Prisma** as our type-safe ORM with **Neon** for PostgreSQL hosting. Set up your database first since everything else depends on it.

```bash
# Copy database environment
cp packages/db/.env.example packages/db/.env
```

Edit `packages/db/.env` and add your database URL:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/Turbocamp?schema=public"
# Or use Neon: postgresql://username:password@your-neon-url/turbocamp?schema=public
```

Run migrations to set up your database:
```bash
pnpm migrate
```

#### 3. API Setup (Better Auth + Centralized Endpoints)

Your API handles authentication, database operations, and serves all clients. It's the heart of your application.

```bash
# Copy API environment
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env.local
```

Edit `apps/api/.env.local` and add your auth secret:
```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-32-character-secret-key-here"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3002"
# Add your database URL here too
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url-from-step-2"
```

#### 4. Dashboard Setup (Main Application)

Your dashboard is where authenticated users manage their accounts and access core features.

```bash
# Copy dashboard environment  
cp apps/dashboard/.env.example apps/dashboard/.env.local
```

Edit `apps/dashboard/.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL="http://localhost:3001"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL="http://localhost:3000"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3001"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="same-secret-from-api"
AUTH_API_URL="http://localhost:3002"
```

#### 5. Internationalization Setup (Multi-language Support)

Set up i18n for global reach. This is used by your web app for multi-language support.

```bash
# Copy i18n environment for multi-language support
cp packages/i18n/.env.example packages/i18n/.env.local
```

#### 6. Web Setup (Marketing Site)

Your marketing site showcases your product and converts visitors into users.

```bash
# Copy web environment
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Edit `apps/web/.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL="http://localhost:3001"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://localhost:3002"
AUTH_API_URL="http://localhost:3002"
```

#### 7. Launch Your Applications

```bash
pnpm dev
```

🎉 **You're live!** Your applications are now running:
- **Marketing Site**: http://localhost:3000 - Your public-facing website
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001 - Your main application for authenticated users  
- **API**: http://localhost:3002 - Your centralized backend serving all clients
- **Email Preview**: http://localhost:3003 - Preview your email templates
- **Database Studio**: http://localhost:5555 - Visual database management

#### 8. Content Management (Optional)

We use **Content Collections** for type-safe, file-based content management. Perfect for blogs, documentation, and marketing pages.

```bash
# Copy CMS environment (optional)
cp packages/cms/.env.example packages/cms/.env.local
```

Your content lives in `apps/web/content/` - edit `.mdx` files and see changes instantly!

#### 9. Documentation Site (Optional)

Want to add documentation? We've got you covered with **Fumadocs** - a beautiful, fast documentation framework.

```bash
# Copy docs environment (optional)
cp apps/docs/.env.example apps/docs/.env.local
```

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=docs
```

Your docs will be available at: http://localhost:3004

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Use `pnpm` for best compatibility with monorepos. You can also use `bun` or `npm`, but pnpm is recommended for optimal performance.

## API Architecture & Authentication Flow

**One API to rule them all.** Our centralized API architecture gives you superpowers - build once, connect everywhere.

### 🏗️ Centralized API Design

**Why centralized?** Your API at `localhost:3002` becomes the single source of truth for all your applications. Whether you're building a web app, mobile app, or desktop client, they all speak to the same backend.

```

### 🔐 Dual Authentication Strategy

**Best of both worlds.** We've implemented a smart dual-auth approach that optimizes for different user journeys:

#### 🌐 Web App (Marketing Site)
- **Auth Modal** - Quick signup/signin without leaving the page
- **Perfect for conversions** - Users can sign up instantly from CTA buttons
- **Seamless experience** - Modal opens, user signs up, gets redirected to dashboard
- **Mobile-optimized** - Works beautifully on all screen sizes

#### 📊 Dashboard App (Main Application)
- **Full Auth Pages** - Complete signup/signin experience with proper navigation
- **Enhanced UX** - Welcome messages, forgot password flows, and cross-navigation
- **Professional feel** - Dedicated pages that feel like a complete application
- **Accessibility first** - Proper focus management and screen reader support

### 🔄 Cross-Domain Session Management

**One login, everywhere access.** Our session management works across all your applications:

```typescript
// Your sessions work across all domains
const session = await auth.getSession();
// ✅ Works on web app (localhost:3000)
// ✅ Works on dashboard (localhost:3001)  
// ✅ Works on API (localhost:3002)
// ✅ Works on production (.turbocamp.dev)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Secure cookies** with proper SameSite and Secure flags
- **Cross-subdomain sharing** for seamless multi-app experience
- **Automatic refresh** - sessions extend automatically with activity
- **Proper cleanup** - logout clears sessions across all apps

### 📱 Mobile & API First

**Built for the future.** Your API is RESTful and mobile-ready from day one:

```bash
# Your API endpoints work with any client
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/auth/sign-up/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "securepass123"}'
```

**Perfect for:**
- **React Native apps** - Use the same auth endpoints
- **Flutter applications** - REST API integration out of the box
- **Third-party integrations** - Webhook endpoints and API keys ready
- **Desktop applications** - Electron or Tauri apps can connect easily

### 🛡️ Production Security

**Security is not an afterthought.** Every API call is protected:

- **CORS configured** - Proper cross-origin request handling
- **Rate limiting** - Protect against abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Input validation** - Zod schemas validate all inputs
- **Secure headers** - CSRF protection and security headers
- **Environment isolation** - Different configs for dev/staging/production

## Project Structure

**Why Vercel?** Built by the Next.js team, optimized for our stack, and generous free tier.

1. **Connect your repository** to Vercel
2. **Set environment variables** in the Vercel dashboard
3. **Deploy** - Vercel automatically builds and deploys your apps

```bash
npx vercel
```

### 🐳 Docker (Self-Hosted)

**Full control over your infrastructure.** Perfect for AWS, GCP, or your own servers.

```bash
